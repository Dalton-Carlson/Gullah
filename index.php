    <p>Welcome to the Gullah Geechee Communities website! The Gullah Geechee are descendants of enslaved Africans, who worked on rice plantations in the lower Atlantic Coast. After gaining their freedom following the Civil War, many Gullah Geechee people united to and formed communities in the lowcountry region of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Today, this area is called the Gullah Geechee Corridor.</p>
